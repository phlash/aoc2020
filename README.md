# 2020 Advent of Code solutions in python

I've not played Advent of Code (AoC) before, but now that I'm retired I thought it might be fun and I have the time :)

## Caveat reader

These are not elegant solutions, I agreed along with the couple of other people I knew were doing these to leave the first working solution as-is,
no tidying up or optimising.

## Some tests included

Those challenges that did not 'just work' after a couple of attempts, I used the examples provided as test, which can be run by `cd`ing to the
`test` folder and running `../solve.py`

Enjoy!
